                <p>Hello, all!</p>
                <p>Today is my first day at REUSE! In honor of my mentor and recommender, the visionary Dr. Chris Johnson of
                    JMU, I&#39;m going to keep a little blog of my time here at CMU.</p>
                <p>It is 6pm. My roommate will move in soon. We&#39;ll see how much I write.</p>

                <p>Fortune favors the bold... and those who know good writers, apparently! By the strokes of fortune and the keystrokes of Dr. Johnson, I&#39;ve landed an invitation to the CMU Research Experience for Undergraduates in Software Engineering program.</p>

            <div class="ml-par-margin">
                <p>My topic: formal verification of network protocols. Wow! Those intimidating words are the gateway to a world of pure mathematical imagination. </p>
                <p>Leslie Lamport (as in Lamport clocks) wrote a language called <em>TLA+</em>. I&#39;m not sure what it stands for. Maybe Translation LookAside Plus? (Probably not!)</p>
                <p>My current task: to learn the TLA+ language, some relevant protocols such as Paxos (If I remember correctly, the two-phase distributed consensus protocol), and read some articles on robustness in software. </p>
                <p>Lamport is very opinionated about TLA+, insisting that mathematical truth is the superior means of representing abstract algorithms. I&#39;m skeptical, but exploring new means of computation is very exciting! Plus, concurrent systems are infamously hard to debug. We&#39;ve tried the code monkey way. Maybe it&#39;s time to step aside and give the mathematicians a try?</p>

                <p>I woke up in  a hotel with a very kind father who drove me here yesterday. We visited some parks. We ate some food. He helped me move in. The elevators were slow. Now he&#39;s gone!</p>
                <p>OK, now you&#39;re caught up! Time to think about the future.</p>

                <p>Tomorrow is orientation day #1! A breakfast has been scheduled for 9:30am for some hardcore (human, not computer) networking. Then, we&#39;re supposed to have lunch with our advisors. One of mine is getting married. The other awaits his newborn child&#39;s birth. </p>
                <p>It turns out, however, that I&#39;ve got a partner named Eduardo! Maybe we&#39;ll chill together instead?</p>

                <p>Then, I&#39;ve got some Lamport Lectures to watch and some papers to read!</p>
